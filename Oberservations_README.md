# Unit 5 | Assignment - The Power of Plots


Observations: 
1. In Uuban cities there are more rides completed and more drivers compared to rural & suburban. In urban cities, there is a higher density of population idicating the demand of Pyber is higher. Also, the cost of owning your vehicle is significantly higher in urban area compared to rural: insruance costs, parking costs, gas, and registraton costs. A resident in urban area may chose to use Pyber for transportation rather than owning thier own vehicle. 

2. In rural cities the avg fare is significanlty higher than avg fare for rides in urban area. In rural areas, my assumption is avg distance per ride is longer than distance traveled in urban areas. In rural cities, starting and ending destinations are further aprat. Urban cities have introduced pool options, cheaper fares if riders carpool with other riders. 

3. In suburban cities fares, drivers, and riders lay in the middle of rural and urban cities. Riders who reside in suburbs may chose to use pyber to visit the nearby urban city, to save on parking costs and convience.
